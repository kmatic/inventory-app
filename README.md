# inventory-app
simple inventory management app built with Node.js & Express. 

## Skills learned/improved

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose (MongoDB)
- MVC architectural pattern
- EJS templating
- middleware use

Decided to only implement the read aspect of CRUD operations as this project was basically another version of the locallibrary tutorial from the odin project and did not put much effort into the styling of the views.
